DIY PPG: COMPARISON OF WAVEFORM PARAMETERS FROM OPEN-SOURCE VS COMMERCIAL PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY

Abstract: Commercial pulse oximeters often use proprietary data acquisition and visualization techniques, 
making it difficult to perform digital signal processing on waveform data. Careful, detailed analysis is 
critical when using the photoplethysmogram (PPG) for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Open hardware 
and software systems offer full access the PPG signal itself plus the algorithms for acquiring and 
analyzing the signal. This study compares parameters obtained from PPG signal using a closed system to 
that same data using an open system. The viability of a future FDA-approved open-source pulse sensing 
ystem is explored. The inter beat interval, average beats per minute, and waveform visualization techniques 
were compared. Data acquisition techniques were explored and compared between the systems as well as 
hardware and algorithmic comparisons. Code for accessing the data from the devices, analyzing the data, and 
visualizing the data will be discussed. Languages included Python, Arduino, Processing, C++, and RISC-based 
assembly.
